# Bug Jump (Frogger Clone)
Phil the Bug is trying to reach the cool waters of the pond, but the bustling ladybugs are not going to make it easy.  Can you reach the pond without getting trampled?  Don't forget to collect gems to increase your score on your way to the lake. This project is part of the [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanoprogram](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Instructions
The object of the game is to make it across the board without getting touched by any of the fast moving ladybugs.  To increase your score collect the gems that randomly appear around the board.  To have the gems reappear, you must make it across to the pond.  Movement of Phil the Bug is done through the keyboard arrow keys.

## Getting Started
All files are included in the project repository.  To get the game started on your own computer, just clone/download the zip file from this repository to your computer and open the index.html file.  The index.html expects the directories to be:
* ./js/     -> app.js, engine.js, resources.js
* ./css/    -> style.css
* ./images/ -> contains images from the Udacity repo (Including a custom "Game Over" image I created with the included assests)

## Prerequisites
None

## Live Demo

## Built With
Uses the included images and "Game Engine" from the forked repo.  All code is written in plain 'ol JS with no Frameworks.

## Contributing
Since this is a personal project for a web development course, pull requests would probably be denied.  Feel free to fork into your own repo to add additional features.
